# embedded-water-depth-sensor

## Opening
This project demonstrates the implementation of a water depth sensor using an Arduino and various components. The goal is to accurately measure water depth and display the information on an LCD.

## Functions and Uses
- **Measure Water Depth:** The primary function of this project is to measure the depth of water using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Display Information:** The measured depth is displayed on an LCD screen.
- **Visual Indicators:** Different colored LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) indicate the status of the water level.

## Components Used
- **Arduino:** The microcontroller used to control the circuit.
- **HCSR04:** Ultrasonic sensor used for measuring the distance.
- **Resistor:** Used for current limiting and protecting the components.
- **LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green):** Visual indicators for water level status.
- **LM016L:** LCD 16Ã—2 for displaying the measured depth.
- **Power Supply:** To power the Arduino and components.
- **Ground Connection:** Essential for completing the circuit.
